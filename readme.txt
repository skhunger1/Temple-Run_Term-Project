Temple Run 112, by Simran Khunger; andrewID: skhunger

Temple Run 112 mimics the popular Temple Run app as created by Imangi studios. 
It involves a person running constantly down a randomly generated path while 
supposedly being chased by monkeys. The person must avoid obstacles by jumping 
over them and must make turns at the right place/time in order to stay alive. 
The aim of the game is to collect coins on the path to raise their score. 
This coin collection is aided by powerups along the way, such as invincibility, 
a speed boost that automatically plays the game for the player for 
a short length of time, or automatically collects coins for the player as he passes the coins.
Temple Run 112 also features a user-interactive leaderboard.

To run this project, enter the ProjectCodebase file, and then run "Game.py." This may involve running
the other pyzo-based .py files in the folder as well, if they haven't been run before.

The game employs the pygame module, as well as math, random, pathlib, operator, and numpy.

The shortcut for testing purposes is if during the game you press the lowercase 'o' key once. 
This will trigger the game AI system (also known as the AI powerup) without actually
collecting the AI powerup. The AI will last for a certain duration of time before returning to normal.
